acinclude (automake) is in branch
DomenWork2020_DevGtk2_hotkey

makefiles may also be there. At least partially. Otherwise copy from qt version from domenwork2020

Also, wclion/master has some useful parts. Makefile hide annoying warnings, configure and so on.

c6df5e92ffcfc342b93973917d3e352890d112f3 (wclion/master) starts with thumbbar.
I will do globals first and perfect it. Then merge. Then thumbbar.
